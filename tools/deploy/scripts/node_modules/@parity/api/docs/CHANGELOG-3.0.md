# `@parity/api` v3.0.0

## Breaking Changes

- Moved the repo from https://github.com/parity-js/api to https://github.com/paritytech/js-libs/packages/api. The package location on NPM has not been changed.
- Removed the utility to create a blockie identicon: `@parity/api/lib/utils/createIdentityImg`. Please directly use the [`blockies`](https://github.com/download13/blockies) instead.
