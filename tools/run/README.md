# Running Fluence node
This document describes how to run your own local Fluence network. It will be connected to local Ethereum and Swarm networks.

## Prerequisites
You will need installed [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and Docker.

_Please note that this guide only works on macOS and Linux._

## Running Fluence network
It's just two steps:

1. Run local Ethereum: `$ ./blockchain.sh`
2. Run docker containers: `$ ./compose.sh`

Now you're ready to publish your code to Fluence network.

## Publishing your code to the Fluence network
Please refer to [Fluence CLI](https://github.com/fluencelabs/fluence/tree/master/cli) README.
