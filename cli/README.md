## Fluence Publisher

Current code deployment process to the Fluence network looks like this:

- Upload code to Swarm. Swarm will return the code hash.
- Publish the received hash to a default “deployer” contract in a blockchain (ethereum as a default).

**Fluence Publisher** is a console automation utility that will take the code as an input, go through the publishing process and return a hash of transaction of publishing to the developer, if successful.

 ## Requirements
 
- a connection to the Ethereum node (including light client) that is able to broadcast a transaction
- Ethereum account with a balance sufficient to pay for gas
- address of the Swarm node

## Installation

Requirements: [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) are needed.

- clone repo and `cd` to `publisher` folder
- run `cargo build`
- go to `target/debug`
- there is an executable file `fluence` to work with
