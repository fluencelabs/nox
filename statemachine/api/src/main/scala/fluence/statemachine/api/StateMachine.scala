 * StateMachine represents the working, configured state machine.

 * State machine takes commands from some interface (might be native, in case it's launched within the same JVM,
 * or might provide just ABCI) and replies on queries on its own.
 *
 * We have only two meaningful and stable query methods: query and status. In case some block producer needs
 * more, e.g. StateHash/BlockReceipt, it's just implementation details and should not affect the general picture.
