## What is Fluence?

On a basic level Fluence is a decentralized database that utilizes p2p network of independent peers as a storage for various types of datastructures (not only files). The peers are connected into a network using modified Kademlia protocol. Fluence provides all of the traditional database features with additional encryption and scalability. Fluence network is failproof by design, has no single point of failure, and is independent of any company, brand or other authority of any kind.

## Fluence Papers
