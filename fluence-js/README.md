## Fluence Javascript Client

**Fluence Javascript Client** allows you to interact with a real-time cluster from a browser or use it like `npm` module. 

## Motivation

Browser client simplifies interaction with the real-time cluster for a user. It has zero dependencies and can be added to other code.
Developers can deploy their backend code to Fluence network and built a web3 application based on **Fluence Client** to interact with this backend code.
It is written on TypeScript to reach more clean, understandable and typesafe code with good reusability.
