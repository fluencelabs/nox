   * The search begins by selecting alpha contacts from the non-empty k-bucket closest to the bucket appropriate
   * to the key being searched on. If there are fewer than alpha contacts in that bucket, contacts are selected
   * from other buckets. The contact closest to the target key, closestNode, is noted.
   *
   * The first alpha contacts selected are used to create a shortlist for the search.
   *
   * The node then sends parallel, asynchronous FIND_* RPCs to the alpha contacts in the shortlist.
   * Each contact, if it is live, should normally return k triples. If any of the alpha contacts fails to reply,
   * it is removed from the shortlist, at least temporarily.
   *
   * The node then fills the shortlist with contacts from the replies received. These are those closest to the target.
   * From the shortlist it selects another alpha contacts. The only condition for this selection is that they have not
   * already been contacted. Once again a FIND_* RPC is sent to each in parallel.
   *
   * Each such parallel search updates closestNode, the closest node seen so far.
   *
   * The sequence of parallel searches is continued until either no node in the sets returned is closer than the
   * closest node already seen or the initiating node has accumulated k probed and known to be active contacts.
   *
   * If a cycle doesn't find a closer node, if closestNode is unchanged, then the initiating node sends a FIND_* RPC
   * to each of the k closest nodes that it has not already queried.
   *
   * At the end of this process, the node will have accumulated a set of k active contacts or (if the RPC was FIND_VALUE)
   * may have found a data value. Either a set of triples or the value is returned to the caller.
