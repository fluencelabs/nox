# Introduction
## What is Fluence?
Fluence is a decentralized data processing platform that allows to achieve latency of few seconds for request processing and computational redundancy similar to traditional cloud computing.

In order to achieve low latency and high throughput, Fluence trades security. Fluence provides moderate guarantees that results delivered to the client are correct, but warrants that served results will eventually be additionally verified. If during the additional verification it is found that results were produced incorrectly, offending network nodes lose their deposits.

In the next section we will provide a brief Fluence overview.
