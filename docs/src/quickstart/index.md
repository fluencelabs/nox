# Quickstart

This document will guide you through the three major steps of development with Fluence.

You will develop a two-tiered web application with the Rust backend and the JavaScript frontend. While the architecture of this application resembles a conventional centralized one, the backend will get magically decentralized and will run on top of the Fluence network.

First, you will use the Fluence Rust SDK to develop the backend and compile it to a WebAssembly package. After that, to deploy the obtained backend package to the Fluence network, you will upload it to IPFS and publish the IPFS reference to the Fluence smart contract. Finally, you will build the frontend which will interact with the backend running in the Fluence network.
