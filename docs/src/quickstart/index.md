# Quickstart

This document will guide you through three main steps of development with Fluence.

You will develop a traditional two-tiered web application with a backend written in Rust, and a frontend built with JavaScript. Unlike traditional two-tiered architecture, however, your backend will be decentralized and running on top of the Fluence network, not requiring a dedicated server machine.

We will show you how to use Fluence Rust SDK to develop a backend in Rust, and compile it to WebAssembly. Then, to deploy your backend to the Fluence network, you will publish it to the Fluence smart contract. And finally, build a frontend integrated with your decentralized backend.
