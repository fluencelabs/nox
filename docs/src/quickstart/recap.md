# Recap
Thanks for finishing the quickstart guide! 

A short recap of what you have developed and learned:

- How to set up Rust and Node.js environments from scratch.
- How to interact with Ethereum and Swarm through the Fluence CLI.
- How to spin up a decentralized backend running in the Fluence network, and build frontend applications interacting with this backend.

Hope this was fun!
