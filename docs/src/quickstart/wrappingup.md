# Wrapping up
Thanks for finishing quick start guide! 

A short recap of what you have developed and learned:

- Set up a Rust and Node.js environments from zero to compiling Webassembly backend and a working web application. 
- Start with Rust basics, and end up using complex procedural macros and processing user input. 
- Interact with Ethereum and alter Fluence network state. 
- Spin up real decentralized backend on top of miners' machines, and integrate JavaScript web app with the backend.

Hope this was fun. If you experienced any problems with this guide or Fluence, or just want to chat with the team, feel free to join our [Discord](TODO) and ask as many questions as you want.
