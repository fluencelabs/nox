# Wrapping up
Thanks for finishing quick start guide! 

A short recap of what you have developed and learned:

- Set up a Rust and Node.js environments from zero to compiling Webassembly backend and a working web application. 
- Start with Rust basics, and end up using complex procedural macros and processing user input. 
- Interact with Ethereum and alter Fluence network state. 
- Spin up real decentralized backend on top of miners' machines, and integrate JavaScript web app with that backend.

Hope this was fun. If you experienced any problems with this guide or Fluence, or just want to chat with the team, feel free to join our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/AjfbDKQ)!

If you want to do more with Fluence, you can help us out by looking at [open problems](../unsolved.md) or [open issues](https://github.com/fluencelabs/fluence/issues), and give us some feedback.
 
 Also, there are more examples of [backends]() and [web apps](), take a look.
