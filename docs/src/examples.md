# Examples

We have provided few simple applications utilizing the Fluence network infrastructure:

- [Hello world](https://github.com/fluencelabs/tutorials/tree/master/hello-world/app-sdk-rust-2018) is a basic demo application demonstrating Fluence SDK usage
- [Llamadb](https://github.com/fluencelabs/tutorials/tree/master/llamadb) is a port of an existing in-memory SQL database
- [Tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/fluencelabs/tutorials/tree/master/tic-tac-toe) is a basic [perfect information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information) multi-player game
- [Dice game](https://github.com/fluencelabs/tutorials/tree/master/dice-game) demonstrates how an RNG can be used to implement a simple gambling application
- [Guess the Number](https://github.com/fluencelabs/tutorials/tree/master/guessing-game) is an invalid implementation of an imperfect information game (which cannot be launched on Fluence at the current moment)
- [Streamr analytics](https://github.com/fluencelabs/tutorials/tree/master/streamr) is a simple analytics built on top of a [blockchain-based data marketplace](https://www.streamr.com/)
