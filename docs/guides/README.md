# How to use Fluence
In Fluence, you can play one of three roles, you can be:
1. A miner, providing your computation power to the Fluence Network
2. A backend developer, deploying your Webassembly backend application to miners' nodes
3. A frontend developer, using someone's backend to develop end-user application

## How to become a miner
To learn how to register your computer as a Fluence Node, please refer to [Miner Guide](miner.md)

## How to build backend app with Fluence
To learn how to build you backend with the help of [Fluence SDK](../../backend-sdk/README.md), compile it to [Webassembly](https://webassembly.org), and publish to Fluence smart contract, please read [Backend Developer Guide](backend.md)

## How to develop web apps using Fluence's backends
If you already have a backend you want to use, and it's deployed to Fluence network, you can use it to build a web app with decentralized backend with ease. To do that, you'd need knowledge from [Fronend Developer Guide](frontend.md)
