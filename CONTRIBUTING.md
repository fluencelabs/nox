## Contribute Code

You are welcome to contribute to Fluence.

Things you need to know:

1.  You need to **agree to the Contributors License Agreement**. This is a common practice in all major Open Source projects. At the current moment we are unable to accept contributions made on behalf of a company. Only individual contributions will be accepted.
2.  **Not all proposed contributions can be accepted**. Some features may e.g. just fit a third-party add-on better. The contribution must fit the overall direction of Fluence and really improve it. The more effort you invest, the better you should clarify in advance whether the contribution fits: the best way would be to just open an issue to discuss the contribution you plan to make.

### Contributor License Agreement

When you contribute, you have to be aware that your contribution is covered by **Apache License 2.0**, but might relicensed under few other software licenses mentioned in the **Contributor License Agreement**.
In particular you need to agree to the [Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/fluencelabs-org/3f4cbb3cc14c1c0fb9ad99d8f7316ed7).
